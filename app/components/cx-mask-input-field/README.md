# CxJS Mask Input Field

#### Chout out out [Demo](https://angry-kirch-e6040c.netlify.app/dashboard)

Text Field component that allows you to add a custom mask on it. **_You need to bind the value to the store!_**

## Install

Mask Input Field can be installed with both Yarn and NPM:

`yarn add cx-mask-input-field`
`npm install cx-mask-input-field`

## Properties

#### `mask` : `string`

Mask string. Default format characters are:<br/>

`9`: `0-9`<br/>

`a`: `A-Z, a-z`<br/>

`*`: `A-Z, a-z, 0-9`

Any character can be escaped with a backslash. It will appear as a double backslash in JS strings. For example, a German phone mask with unremoveable prefix +49 will look like <code>mask="+4\\9 99 999 99"</code> or <code>mask={'+4\\\\9 99 999 99'}</code>

### `maskPlaceholder` : `string`

Character to cover unfilled parts of the mask. Default character is "\_". If set to null or empty string, unfilled parts will be empty as in ordinary input.

## Packages and Libraries

### react-input-mask

Component is based on [react-input-mask](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-input-mask) component, which is wrapped in CxJS Widget. This makes it functional out-of-the-box, once you have bind value in the store.

## Example

```jsx
import { MaskInputField } from 'cx-mask-input-field';

<MaskInputField value-bind="data" mask="99.99.99.99" maskPlaceholder="_" />;
```
